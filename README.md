- Cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, and Render for deployment  

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:  
- Open-source projects related to AI, machine learning, or web development  
- Building tools or applications that leverage AI for creative purposes (e.g., content generation, automation, etc.)  
- Collaborative projects that involve full-stack development or innovative tech solutions  

📫 How to reach me:

⚡ Fun fact:  
- I love exploring how AI can be used to solve real-world problems and enhance creativity!  
- My favorite part of web development is designing user-friendly interfaces that not only make people smile but also seamlessly integrate with AI technologies, such as chatbots or content recommendation systems. 😊
